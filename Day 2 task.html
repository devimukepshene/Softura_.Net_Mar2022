<p>Boil water along with oil and salt. If you are using a store bought idiyappam flour and you have stored it in refrigerator, then boil the water nicely. If your rice flour or idiyappam flour is at room temperature, then boil the water till the bubbles starts to rise up in the water. Take the idiyappam flour or rice flour in a mixing bowl. To that, add the boiled water little by little.Mix the flour with the backside of a ladle till all the flour are mixed well and you have got a soft dough. Stop adding water once all the rice flour are mixed up. Take the idiyappam press and fix the idiyappam mould and lightly grease the press with oil to avoid stickiness.To this add 1 fist full of  dough  and close the idiyappam press. Take the idli plate or idiyappam plate and grease the plates with oil. Squeeze the dough onto the idli plates in a circular motion.We can also place a damp cloth on the idli plate and then squeeze the dough. Now place the idli plates in a steamer and steam it until done. This is similar like how you cook idly in the cooker. Allow it to cool for a while and carefully remove the idiyappams to a serving Plate.The yummy idiyappam is ready to serve with sambar / sweet cocunut milk / Idiyappa Kurma.
